# User Management Application

A modern user management system built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features include CRUD operations, filtering, column visibility, and a responsive UI. This project uses JSON Server for mock API in development and seamlessly falls back to localStorage for data persistence when deployed (no backend required on Vercel).
